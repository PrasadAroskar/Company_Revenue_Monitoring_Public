# Background: 
A company valuation is a general process of determining the economic value of the entire business / company unit. This valuation can be used to determine a fair value of the company for variety of reasons including sale value, partner ownerships, taxation, etc. This valuation is often evaluated in terms of revenue. Revenue can be defined as the income that a business has from its normal business activities, usually from its sale of goods and services to the customers. Revenue determines where the company’s net profit. A high value indicates profit while a low value indicates loss. This revenue can be found out in the company’s balance sheet / profit and loss reports. The balance sheet reveals the firm’s asset, liabilities and owner’s equity. So, in order to determine the financial position of the company at a single point in time it very important for this balance sheets to be accurate. In order to get the precise values in the balance sheet we need to have good database for all the departments/ modules involved in the company’s business processes. Here we intend to make good relational database for the various modules present in a company like advertising, non-variable overheads, commercial sales data, costing, etc. Also, using these modules we plan to make the full year & monthly Profit and Loss reports.

# Scope:
1. Create 5-6 tables in each of the modules like advertising, non-variable overheads, commercial sales data, costing, product data etc. 
2. Connect the tables using the various concepts explained in the class and make a relational database.
3. Maintain a huge data in these tables
4. Design the balance sheet by considering the various P&L lines.
5. Create formulae for the calculation of each of the P&L line as per the business processes followed commonly.
6. Write SQL queries to fetch the data as per the formulae mentioned above
7. Design web page to show the company’s monitoring system and display the generated balance sheet on the browser.
8. Also, provide features on the web page to run the report month wise as well as for previous years.
